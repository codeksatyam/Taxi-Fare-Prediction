**Taxi Fare Prediction Project**:-
This is a machine learning project that aims to predict taxi fares based on various factors such as pickup and drop-off locations, distance traveled, time of day, and weather conditions. The dataset used for this project is the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) Trip Record Data, which contains over 1 billion taxi trips from 2009 to 2019.

**Data Exploration and Preprocessing**:-
The project begins with an exploration of the dataset, including visualizations and statistical analysis of the data. The data is then preprocessed to clean and transform it into a format suitable for machine learning models.

**Feature Engineering**:-
The next step is feature engineering, where new features are created based on the existing data to improve the accuracy of the model. This includes calculating the distance between pickup and drop-off locations, extracting the day of the week and time of day from the pickup time, and incorporating weather data.

**Model Building and Evaluation**:-
Multiple machine learning models are trained and evaluated on the preprocessed dataset to find the best performing model. This includes linear regression, decision tree, random forest, and XGBoost. The evaluation metrics used include mean squared error, root mean squared error, and R-squared.
